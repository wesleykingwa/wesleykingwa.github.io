        We are all tired of having to <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pay">pay</a> for extra content after having already paid for the game itself. This happens frequently today and often happens multiple times throughout the entirety of a given game.

            <img src="paytoplay.jpg" width= "300">
            <p5>Implementing a "pay to play" system can turn a $60 game into a $100 game. It also, in a sense, gets the gamer hooked and makes purchasing the content more desireable </p5>
